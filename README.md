HTML to Markdown tool, designed to migrate content from Google Sites to gitlab pages.

Tested with [fiquipedia.es](http://fiquipedia.es) (Work in progress)

## A bit of history
In 2012, a one-man army started building [fiquipedia.es](http://fiquipedia.es), hosted on 
[Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/). This page promptly became a reference in the 
Physics and Chemistry Spanish educational landscape. 

Unfortunately Google decided to discontinued Google Sites Classics from September 1st, 2021 on. 
So, our lonely hero decided to migrate the huge amount of content to 
[Gitlab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/). The pre-existing HTML to Markdown migration 
tools did not provide a clean Markdown, so I decided to help.

If you have a Physics or Chemistry problem, if no one else can help, 
and if you can browse to [fiquipedia.es](http://fiquipedia.es) and you find the solution....maybe you can 
[buy a coffe to fiquipedia.es](https://ko-fi.com/fiquipedia).
